description: Angular Bites will review your code - 1-week slots open!
---

This is something I've wanted to do for a while - but my schedule was busy with
a pretty intensive assignment.

As I will have some more free time going forward, **I would like to spend
1 hour each week for reviewing your code**, project/architecture assessment, or just to hear and (hopefully!) answer any questions you may have.

As I understand your code is likely proprietary, I'd be happy to sign NDAs if you need me to have access to any code.

Please use the Calendly widget below to book a slot

<div class="calendly-inline-widget" data-url="https://calendly.com/angular-bites" style="min-width:320px;height:900px;"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.js"></script>
